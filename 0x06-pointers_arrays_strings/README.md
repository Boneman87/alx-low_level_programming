The learning objectives of this project are as follows, to enable the student create functions similar to that of the standard library's:
1.	Knowing pointers and arrays, and how to use them
2.	Knowing the differences betweeen pointers and arrays
3.	Knowing how to use strings and manipulate them
4.	Scope of variables

The following are mandatory tasks:
Task 0:	A function that concatenates two strings; it appends the src string to the dest string, overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of dest, and then adds a terminating null byte. It then returns a pointer to the resulting string dest.

Task 1:	Another function that concatenates two strings; similar to the Task 0 function, but this uses at most n bytes from src, src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes. It also returns a pointer to the resulting string dest.

Task 2:	A function that copies strings, just like the standard strncpy.

Task 3:	A function that compares two strings, just like the standard library strcmp.

Task 4:	A function that reverses the content of an array of integer.

Task 5:	A function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.

Task 6:	A function that capitalizes all words of a string

Task 7:	A function that encodes a string into 1337.
